<!--
The main template file. It is required in all themes.

The front-page.php template file is used to render your site’s front page,
whether the front page displays the blog posts index (mentioned above) or a
static page. The front page template takes precedence over the blog posts index
(home.php) template. If the front-page.php file does not exist, WordPress will
either use the home.php or page.php files depending on the setup in
Settings → Reading. If neither of those files exist, it will use the index.php
file.

As this theme has the front-page.php and home.php files, index.php is empty.
